# Whole Life Insurance

There are two main types of life insurance: temporary and permanent. Temporary life insurance(also known term life) covers the insured person for a fixed amount of time, for example, 10, 20, or 30 years. Hopefully, you are a lucky one and did not die. In this case, all the premiums paid into term life insurance are gone. The second option, which is permanent life insurance covers you for the rest of your life as long as you pay premiums and your beneficiaries get a lump sum at the end of your life. This is a traditional view of life insurance when you focus on benefits your beneficiaries receive, so-called death benefits. 

A dividend-paying permanent whole life insurance by Guardian offers benefits that you as an insured person can take benefit of while you are still alive. This is often referred to as living benefits.

Here are a few benefits that Whole Life offers:
- dividends paid on the cash value in the whole life 
- ability to borrow **against** your cash value
- same premium for the rest of your life. (in comparison to term life insurance which the premium goes up every time you renew it)
- Tax-deferred growth
- a piece of mind!

This is the oversimplified flow of cash from your payments.  There are three types of payments you pay to your life insurance: 
Premium (covers your life insurance)
Scheduled paid-up addition(PUA) and unscheduled paid-up addition. (both paid-up addition go to your cash value (after the insurance company takes a fee. It can be 5% or 10%). the scheduled PUA is required and the unscheduled PUA is optional.)
Every year you can contribute up to the MEC limit to your whole life insurance cash value as unscheduled paid-up additions.

## Dividends paid on the cash value in the whole life 
In simple plain language, the insurance company pays you annual dividends on the entire pile of money you have in your whole life insurance cash value. The amount of dividends can vary from year to year depending on multiple factors. However, you get guaranteed dividends at a 3% annual rate regardless of what is going on with the markets. And insurance companies usually pay more than guaranteed(bare minimum). You can check out historic rates for the last many years. In the figure below, I am showing inflation rates, federal reserve rates, and the dividend paid by Guardian Mutual. To get to this stage you need to start early and have a long-term commitment.

## Borrow against the cash value

One of my favorite features of dividend-paying whole life insurance is the ability to borrow against your cash value. The key word here is **against**. If you have $500k in your cash value, you can borrow $500k from the insurance company no questions asked. You will pay a 5% interest rate on borrowed cash **AND** you will be paid dividends on the entire $500k cash value. Remember, you are borrowing against your cash value and not from it. If you do simple math and consider the worth case scenario for a yearly dividend rate (Guaranteed 3%) and your borrow at a 5% rate, you effectively just got $500k at a 2% interest rate. During the lowest federal reserve rate, the mortgage interest rate was around 3%. Isn't it amazing! And this is the worst case. The lowest rate was 5.65% in 2020,2021 and 2022.
 



## MEC limit
A Modified Endowment Contract(MEC) is a strange concept with a strange name. I guess one day bunch of lawyers and legislators got together and decided to have some fun. But it is a very important concept to understand. There are tax implications if you trigger MEC. Three things to remember: 
you can contribute only up to a certain amount to your cash value per year. 
you can only contribute up to a certain total amount to your cash value and 
if your contribution to your cash value is less than MEC limit in a given year, you can catch up in the future. Read 7-pay test by IRS for more details.
