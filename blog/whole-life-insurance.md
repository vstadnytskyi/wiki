# Whole Life Insurance

There are two main types of life insurance: temporary and permanent. Temporary life insurance covers the insured person for a fixed amount of time, for example, 30 years. Hopefully, you are a lucky one and did not die. In this case, all the premiums paid into term life insurance are gone. The second option, which is permanent life insurance covers you for the rest of your life as long as you pay premiums and your beneficiaries get a lump sum at the end of your life. This is a traditional view of life insurance when you focus on benefits your beneficiaries receive, so-called death benefits. 

A dividend-paying permanent life insurance life Whole Life by Guardian offers benefits that you as an insured person can take benefit of while you are still alive.

Here are a few benefits that Whole Life offers.
- dividends paid on the cash value in the whole life 
- ability to borrow **against** your cash value
- same premium for the rest of your life. (in comparison to term life insurance which the premium goes up every time you renew it)
- Tax deferred growth
- a piece of mind!

Let us talk about each statement in the list above. Before that let us discuss what happens to cash you put into whole life insurance. There are three parts: premium, scheduled paid-up addition(PUA) and unscheduled paid-up addition. 
- premium covers your life insurance
- both paid-up addition go to your cash value (after the insurance company takes a fee. It can be 5% or 10%). the scheduled PUA is required and the unscheduled PUA is optional.


## Dividends paid on the cash value in the whole life 
In simple plain language, the insurance company pays you annual dividends on the entire cash value you have in your whole life insurance. The amount of dividends can vary. You get guaranteed dividends at a 3% annual rate regardless of what is going on with the markets. However, insurance companies usually pay more than guaranteed(bare minimum). You can check out historic rates for the last many years. In the figure below, I am showing inflation rates, federal reserve rates, and the dividend paid by Guardian Mutual.

## Borrow against the cash value

One of my favorite features of dividend-paying whole life insurance is the ability to borrow against your cash value. The key word here is **against**. If you have $500k in your cash value, you can borrow $500k from the insurance company no questions asked. You will pay a 5% interest rate on borrowed cash **AND** you will be paid dividends on the entire $500k cash value. Remember, you are borrowing against your cash value and not from it. If you do simple math and consider the worth case scenario for a yearly dividend rate (Guaranteed 3%) and your borrow at a 5% rate, you effectively just got $500k at a 2% interest rate. During the lowest federal reserve rate, the mortgage interest rate was around 3%. Isn't it amazing!
