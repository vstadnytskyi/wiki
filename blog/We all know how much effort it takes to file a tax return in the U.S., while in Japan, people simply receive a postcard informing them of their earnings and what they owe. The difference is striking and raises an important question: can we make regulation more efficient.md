Can We Do Regulation Differently?

We all know how much effort it takes to file a tax return in the U.S., while in Japan, people simply receive a postcard informing them of their earnings and what they owe. The difference is striking and raises an important question: can we make regulation more efficient?

A recent article by The Economist highlights just how burdensome compliance has become: "Americans spend a total of 12bn hours a year complying with federal rules, including those on marketing and selling honey, and following standards on the flammability of children’s pyjamas."

Since I have shifted to entrepreneurship, I have felt this burden myself. There are constant requirements to report this and report that, file this form and file that.

Regulation is necessary—it ensures consumer safety, protects the environment, and maintains financial stability. However, when rules become too complex, they stifle innovation, slow economic growth, and disproportionately burden small businesses. So how can we regulate differently?

Smarter, Streamlined Regulation

Pre-Filled and Automated Compliance

Japan's tax model is an example of how automation can reduce paperwork. Governments could leverage existing data to pre-fill forms, reducing the time and effort required for compliance.

Outcome-Based Regulation

Instead of rigid processes, governments could set broad targets (e.g., reducing emissions by X%) and allow businesses to choose the best compliance method.

Regular Reviews & Sunset Clauses

Regulations should be reviewed periodically to eliminate outdated rules. Automatic sunset clauses would ensure that laws expire unless actively renewed.

Risk-Based Regulation

Not all industries or businesses pose the same level of risk. Regulatory intensity should be proportional to risk, freeing low-risk sectors from excessive oversight.

Leveraging Technology

AI and blockchain could streamline reporting, ensure transparency, and reduce fraud while simplifying compliance for businesses and individuals.

The challenge isn't just cutting red tape but redesigning regulation to be more efficient and adaptive. If Japan can simplify tax filing and other countries can experiment with innovative regulatory frameworks, why can't the rest of the world follow suit?
