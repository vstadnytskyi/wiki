The year 2022 was a great year and I have opened my first start-up. My co-founder and I have started to build up our idea from scratch. As new entreprenuers there is so much to learn. 

It is January 1st 2023 and I woke up in cold sweat. I realized that I need to submit income tax equivalent for our start-up. We are well aware that messing up with Uncle Sam never ends well. What shall we do? We looked at our registration agent in the state of Delaware and there is not that much information about what to do next, except pay them agent fee which is due at the end of January. 

Seems like January is the month when everyone wants money from us.

I assume you are Delaware C Corp and you do not do any business in Delaware yet. You do need to file Delaware Franchise Report and Fees associated with that, though.

Go here https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/LoginTax.aspx?FilingType=FranchiseTax

It is a simple form that you need to fill up before March 1 2023. This report and fee is mandatory for all C-corps and non-profits.

You need to pay tax in the state where you have so called ’Tax Nexus’. Your corporation has tax nexus when you have assets, people on payroll, sales, etc. in that state. With that you will need to file income tax return for your c-corp in the state you do a lot of business. That is your state specific if you need to file it or not. High chances you do not need to file in NY nor in DE since you have no money/no income/no people on a payroll/no nothing :). Check here https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/ct/corp_tax_reform_faqs.htm and if needed send email to your incorporating agent or NY tax collecting agency for clarification.

Correction to my previous email. You most likely do not need to pay any taxes but you need to submit income tax return for your c-corp. Even if you had 0 income. You might have some losses. It is good to report those losses on form 1120 so you can claim them later. It also establishes paper trail for your company.

https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1120 I will be doing our non-profit tax return sometimes later this month. If you can wait, I can tell you what I have learned by then.

Check with your state if you need to file state tax return as well.
