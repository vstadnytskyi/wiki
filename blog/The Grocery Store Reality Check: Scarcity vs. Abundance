The Grocery Store Reality Check: Scarcity vs. Abundance

There’s a story about a Soviet official visiting the U.S. who had heard that Americans could walk into a grocery store, pick whatever they wanted, and just pay at checkout. He was so skeptical that he made an unscheduled stop at a local store—just to see if it was staged.

Why? Because in the Soviet Union, shopping was a whole different experience. You’d tell the store clerk what you wanted, and they’d hand you whatever they had. If you asked for a better apple instead of a bruised one, the response was often:
"Do you want apples or not? Take it or leave it."

People usually took it. Why? Because the alternative was arguing with the clerk or walking away empty-handed. Standing in long lines for basic goods was normal, and customer service? Pretty much nonexistent. Time didn’t hold much value—there weren’t many ways to earn more money, so people spent hours queuing instead.

A real-life example of this culture shock happened in 1989 when Boris Yeltsin visited a Randalls supermarket in Texas. He was blown away by the sheer variety of food available to everyday Americans. Wandering the aisles, he reportedly said, “Even the Politburo doesn’t have this choice!” Later, he admitted, “If the Soviet people saw this, there would be a revolution tomorrow.”

It’s wild to think about how something as simple as choosing your own groceries can highlight a huge difference in mindset, opportunity, and economic systems. In places of scarcity, people accept whatever they get. In places of abundance, competition drives businesses to serve customers better.

It makes you appreciate the little things—like picking the best apple. 🍏
