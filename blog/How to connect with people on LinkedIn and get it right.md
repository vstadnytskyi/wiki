# How to connect with people on LinkedIn and get itÂ right
(Note, this is a draft and please let me know how I can improve it)

LinkedIn became this very popular professional social media platform. And I want to talk a little bit about how the most out of it.
Recently I became shameless and started to connect with people I do not even know. Saying that, I connect with people I am intersted in. The reasons can vary. I have learned that it is important to add a personalize message when you submit connect request that you can find in 'More' tab below your name and your description.

It sometimes asks you to explain how you know the person and it is not shared with your new connection. This information is used internally by LinkedIn. In Fig. 2, you can see possible answer to a question "How do you know John Doe?" Pick one that fits the best. If I do not know John Doe, I will pick "Other"

After that write a personalize message. Remember, I get many requests for connections and if they are not personal I am not going to accept it. I want to have people in my network that are real people I am intersted in and want to stay in touch.
