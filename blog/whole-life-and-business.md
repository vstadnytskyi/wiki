Hi All,

If you hold a Whole Life insurance policy structured for the Infinite Banking Concept, where 90% of my premiums and Paid-Up Additions (PUA) are allocated to the cash value. I plan to use funds borrowed against this policy to finance my business, capitalizing on the tax deductibility of the loan interest.
My understanding is that:
In the U.S., whether funds qualify as loan capital depends on the characteristics of the transaction. It must genuinely function as a loan, which involves a clear expectation of repayment by the lender. Key elements of a bona fide loan include:
Loan Agreement: There must be a formal written agreement outlining:
The loan amount and the specific term of the loan, expressed in years or months.
Detailed repayment terms, including the schedule for repaying the principal.
Interest rates applicable to the unpaid principal, which should reflect a realistic fair market rate for the duration of the loan.
Whether the loan is secured, along with details about the collateral, including its type and value.
Compliance: The borrowing entity, such as an LLC, must adhere to the loan terms, specifically making interest and principal payments on time. Non-compliance can lead the IRS to question the intent behind the transaction, potentially reclassifying it as something other than a loan.
Tax Implications: Interest deductions for the LLC are contingent on the lender reporting the corresponding interest income. Note that if you are the sole member of an LLC, for tax purposes, the entity is considered disregarded. This means transactions between you and the LLC are treated as internal transfers, with no tax implications for income or deductions.
